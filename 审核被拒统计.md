####Guideline 2.5.1 - Performance - Software Requirements

```
发件人 Apple
2.5 Performance: Software Requirements
Guideline 2.5.1 - Performance - Software Requirements

Your app uses the "prefs:root=" non-public URL scheme, which is a private entity. The use of non-public APIs is not permitted on the App Store because it can lead to a poor user experience should these APIs change.

Specifically, your app uses the following non-public URL scheme:

prefs:root=general&path=restrictions

Continuing to use or conceal non-public APIs in future submissions of this app may result in the termination of your Apple Developer account, as well as removal of all associated apps from the App Store.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please revise your app to provide the associated functionality using public APIs or remove the functionality using the "prefs:root" or "App-Prefs:root" URL scheme.

If there are no alternatives for providing the functionality your app requires, you can use Feedback Assistant to submit an enhancement request.
```
原因：本人代码中使用了这句

```
// 打开设置->通用->通知
[[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"prefs:root=General&path=Restrictions"]];

```
解决办法：使用私有api导致被拒，找到”prefs:root”，用相应方法换掉，再重新打包上传即可

####Guideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage
```
We noticed that your app requests the user’s consent to access their camera and photos but does not clarify the use of the camera and photos in the applicable purpose string.

Next Steps

Please revise the relevant purpose string in your app’s Info.plist file to specify why the app is requesting access to the user's camera and photos. You can modify your app's Info.plist file using the property list editor in Xcode.

To help users understand why your app is requesting access to their personal data, all permission request alerts in your app should specify how your app will use the requested feature.

Resources

For additional information and instructions on requesting permission, please review the Requesting Permission section of the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and the Information Property List Key Reference. You may also want to review the Technical Q&A QA1937: Resolving the Privacy-Sensitive Data App Rejection page for details on how to provide a usage description for permission request alerts.
